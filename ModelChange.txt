CRITICAL NEXT STEPS: Database Reset
Because the model relationships have changed, you must reset your database.

Delete Old Migrations: In your portal/migrations/ folder, delete all files except __init__.py.

Drop Database: In MySQL Workbench, run DROP DATABASE connect2give_db;.

Re-create Database: In MySQL Workbench, run CREATE DATABASE connect2give_db;.

Make and Run New Migrations: In your terminal, run python manage.py makemigrations portal and then python manage.py migrate.
